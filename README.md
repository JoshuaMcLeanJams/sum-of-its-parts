## Game

- Pick up the machine parts to upgrade your machine. 

- Each part makes you larger and thus easier to hit! You'll have to fold your ship to get through doors.

- You can't fire while folded.

- Don't die.

- You need all five parts to exit south from the start room, where you'll encounter... something different.

- There are bugs. So many bugs. Try to avoid going diagonally through doorways or dying or going back and forth between roomes too fast.
